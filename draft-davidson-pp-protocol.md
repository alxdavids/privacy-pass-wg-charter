--- abstract

This document specifies the Privacy Pass protocol for privacy-preserving
authorization of clients to servers. The privacy requirement is that
client re-authorization events cannot be linked to any previous initial
authorization. Privacy Pass is intended to be used as a performant
protocol in the Internet setting.

--- middle

# Introduction

A common problem on the Internet is providing an effective mechanism for
servers to derive trust from clients they interact with, without
hampering the accessibility of honest clients. Typically, this can be
done by providing some sort of authorization challenge to the client. A
client that correctly solves the challenge can be provided with a cookie.
This cookie can be presented the next time the client interacts
with the server. The resurfacing of this cookie allows the server to see
that the client passed the authorization check in the past.
Consequently, the server can re-authorize the client again immediately,
without the need for the client to solve a new challenge.

In scenarios where clients need to identify themselves, the
authorization challenge usually takes the form of some sort of login
procedure. Otherwise, the server may just want to verify that the client
demonstrates some particular facet of behavior (such as, for example,
being human). Such cases may only require a lightweight form of
challenge (such as completing a CAPTCHA).

In both cases, if a server issues cookies on successful completion of
challenges, the client can use this cookie to bypass future challenges
presented during the lifetime of the cookie. The downside of this
approach is that it provides the server with the ability to link all of
the client's interactions it witnesses. In these situations, the
client's effective privacy is dramatically reduced.

The Privacy Pass protocol was initially introduced as a mechanism for
authorizing clients that had already been authorized in the past,
without compromising their privacy {{DGSTV18}}. The protocol works by
providing client's with privacy-preserving re-authentication tokens for
a particular server. The tokens are "privacy-preserving" in the sense
that they cannot be linked back to the previous session where they were
issued.

The Internet performance company Cloudflare has already implemented
server-side support for an initial version of the Privacy Pass protocol
{{PPSRV}}, and a client-side implementations is also available {{PPEXT}}.
More recently, a number of applications have been built upon the protocol,
or upon slight variants of it; see: {{TRUST}}, {{OpenPrivacy}},
{{PrivateStorage}}. The protocol can be instantiated using a
cryptographic primitive known as a verifiable oblivious pseudorandom
function (VOPRF) for implementing the authorization mechanism. Such
VOPRF protocols can be implemented over prime-order groups, and
constructions are currently being drafted in separate standardization
processes {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.

The Privacy Pass protocol is split into three stages. The first stage,
initialisation, produces the global server configuration that is
broadcast to (and stored by) all clients. The second stage,
the "issuance" phase provides the client with unlinkable tokens that
can be used to initiate re-authorization with the server in the future.
The third stage, the redemption phase, allows the client to redeem a
given re-authorization token with the server that it interacted with
during the issuance phase. The protocol must satisfy two cryptographic
security requirements known as "unlinkability" and "unforgeability".

This document will lay out the generic description of the protocol,
along with a secure implementation based on the VOPRF primitive. It will
also describe the structure of protocol messages, and the framework for
characterizing possible extensions to the protocol description.

This document DOES NOT cover the architectural framework required for
running and maintaining the Privacy Pass protocol in the Internet
setting. In addition, it DOES NOT cover the choices that are necessary
for ensuring that client privacy leaks do not occur. Both of these
considerations are covered in a separate document
{{draft-davidson-pp-architecture}}.

# Preliminaries {#prelim}

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

The following terms are used throughout this document.

- Server: A service that provides the server-side functionality required
  by the protocol documented here (typically denoted S).
- Client: An entity that seeks authorization from a server that supports
  interactions in the Privacy Pass protocol (typically denoted C).
- Key: The secret key used by the Server for authorizing client data
  (typically denoted key).

We assume that all protocol messages are encoded into raw byte format
before being sent. We use the TLS presentation language {{RFC8446}} to
describe the structure of protocol data types and messages.

## Basic assumptions

We make only a few minimal assumptions about the environment that the
clients and servers supporting the Privacy Pass protocol encounter.

- At any one time, we assume that the Server uses only one configuration
  containing their ciphersuite choice along with their secret key data.
- We assume that the client has access to a global directory of the
  current public parts of the configurations used by all servers.

The wider ecosystem that this protocol is employed in is described in
{{draft-davidson-pp-architecture}}.

# Privacy Pass functional API {#pp-api}

Before describing the protocol itself in {{overview}}, we describe the
underlying functions that are used in substantiating the protocol
itself. Instantiating this set of functions, along with meeting the
security requirements highlighted in {{sec-requirements}}, provides an
instantiation of the wider protocol.

We provide an explicit instantiation of the Privacy Pass API, based on
the public API provided in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.

## Data structures {#pp-structs}

The following data structures are used throughout the Privacy Pass
protocol and are written in the TLS presentation language {{RFC8446}}. It
is intended that any of these data structures can be written into
widely-adopted encoding schemes such as those detailed in TLS
{{RFC8446}}, CBOR {{RFC7049}}, and JSON {{RFC7159}}.

### Ciphersuite {#pp-ciphersuite-struct}

The `Ciphersuite` enum describes the ciphersuite that is used for
instantiating the Privacy Pass protocol. The values that we provide here
are described further in {{pp-ciphersuites}}.

~~~
enum {
  p384_hkdf_sha512_sswu_ro(0)
  p521_hkdf_sha512_sswu_ro(1)
  curve448_hkdf_sha512_ell2_ro(2)
  (255)
} Ciphersuite;
~~~

### ServerConfig {#pp-srv-cfg-struct}

The `ServerConfig` struct describes and maintains the underlying
configuration that is used by the server.

~~~
struct {
  opaque s_id<0..2^16-1>
  Ciphersuite ciphersuite;
  SecretKey key<1..2^32-1>;
  PublicKey pub_key<1..2^32-1>;
  opaque max_evals<0..255>;
} ServerConfig;
~~~

The `SecretKey` and `PublicKey` types are just wrappers around byte
arrays.

~~~
opaque SecretKey<1..2^32-1>;
opaque PublicKey<1..2^32-1>;
~~~

### ServerUpdate {#pp-srv-cfg-update}

The `ServerUpdate` struct contains the public information related to
a new `ServerConfig` message from a server. This is sent either directly
to clients, or indirectly via an update process.

~~~
struct {
  opaque s_id<0..2^16-1>
  Ciphersuite ciphersuite;
  PublicKey pub_key<1..2^32-1>;
  opaque max_evals<0..255>;
} ServerUpdate;
~~~

### ClientConfig {#pp-cli-cfg-struct}

The `ClientConfig` struct describes and maintains the underlying
configuration that is used by the client.

~~~
struct {
  ServerUpdate s_update;
} ClientConfig;
~~~

### ClientIssuanceInput {#pp-cli-issue-input}

The `ClientIssuanceInput` struct describes the data that is generated by
the client, that is necessary for sending to and for processing issuance
data received from the server.

~~~
struct {
  ClientIssuanceProcessing client_process_data;
  ClientIssuanceElement msg_data;
} ClientIssuanceInput;
~~~

The struct contains two internal structs, described below.

~~~
struct {
  opaque client_data<1..2^32-1>;
  opaque gen_data<1..2^32-1>;
} ClientIssuanceProcessing;
~~~

~~~
struct {
  opaque issue_data<1..2^32-1>;
} ClientIssuanceElement;
~~~

### ClientIssuanceMessage {#pp-cli-issue-message}

The `ClientIssuanceMessage` struct corresponds to the message that the
client sends to the server during the issuance phase of the protocol
({{issuance-phase}}).

~~~
struct {
  ClientIssuanceElement issue_element<1..n>
} ClientIssuanceMessage;
~~~

In the above struct, the `issue_element` variable is a vector of
length `n`, where `n` is some value that must
satisfy `n =< m` for `m = max_evals`, as specified in `ServerConfig`.

### ServerIssuanceResponse {#pp-srv-issue-response}

The `ServerIssuanceResponse` struct describes the data returned by the
server that is derived from the issuance message sent by the client.

~~~
struct {
  ServerEvaluation evaluation<1..n>;
  ServerProof proof;
} ServerIssuanceResponse;
~~~

The value of `n` is determined by the length of the
`ClientIssuanceElement` vector in the `ClientIssuanceMessage` struct.
The internal data types are described below:

~~~
struct {
  opaque data<1..2^32-1>;
} ServerEvaluation;
~~~

~~~
struct {
  opaque data<1..2*(2^32)-1>;
} ServerProof;
~~~

### RedemptionToken {#pp-redemption-token}

The `RedemptionToken` struct contains the data required to generate the
client message in the redemption phase of the Privacy Pass protocol.
This data is generated in the issuance phase of the protocol, after
receiving the `ServerIssuanceResponse` message.

~~~
struct {
  opaque data<1..2^32-1>;
  opaque issued<1..2^32-1>;
} RedemptionToken;
~~~

### ClientRedemptionMessage {#pp-redemption-message}

The `RedemptionMessage` struct consists of the data that is sent by the
client during the redemption phase of the protocol
({{redemption-phase}}).

~~~
struct {
  opaque data<1..2^32-1>;
  opaque tag<1..2^32-1>;
  opaque aux<1..2^16-1>;
} ClientRedemptionMessage;
~~~

### ServerRedemptionResponse {#pp-redemption-response}

The `ServerRedemptionResponse` struct corresponds to a boolean value
that indicates whether the `ClientRedemptionMessage` sent by the client
is valid. It can also contain any associated data.

~~~
struct {
  boolean success;
  opaque additional_data<1..2^32-1>;
} ServerRedemptionResponse;
~~~

## API functions {#pp-functions}

The following functions wrap the core of the functionality required in
the Privacy Pass protocol. For each of the descriptions, we essentially
provide the function signature, leaving the actual contents to be
defined by specific instantiations or extensions of the protocol.

### PP_Server_Setup

  `ServerConfig.s_id`.

Outputs:

- `s_cfg`:  A `ServerConfig` struct ({{pp-srv-cfg-struct}}).
- `s_update`: A `ServerUpdate` struct.

Throws:

- `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG` ({{errors}})

### PP_Client_Setup

Run by the client to generate its configuration. The input
public key `pub_key` in the client configuration MUST correspond to a
valid server's public key.

### PP_Process

Run by the client when processing the server response in the issuance
phase of the protocol. The output of this function is an array of
`RedemptionToken` objects that are unlinkable from the server's
computation in `PP_Issue`.

Inputs:

- `cli_cfg`:           A `ClientConfig` struct.
- `issuance_response`: A `ServerIssuanceResponse` struct.
- `processing_data`:   A `ClientIssuanceProcessing` struct.

Outputs:

- `tokens`: A vector of `RedemptionToken` structs, which length is
  equal to the length of the `ServerEvaluation` vector in the
  `ServerIssuanceResponse` struct.

Throws:

- `ERR_PROOF_VALIDATION` ({{errors}})

### PP_Redeem

Run by the client in the redemption phase of the protocol to generate
the client's message.

Inputs:

             auxiliary data.

Outputs:

- `message`: A `ClientRedemptionMessage` struct.

### PP_Verify

Run by the server in the redemption phase of the protocol. Determines
whether the data sent by the client is valid.

Inputs:

- `s_cfg`:   A `ServerConfig` struct.
- `message`: A `ClientRedemptionMessage` struct.

Outputs:

- `response`: A `ServerRedemptionResponse` struct.

## Error types {#errors}

- `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG`: Error occurred when trying to recover
  configuration with unknown identifier
- `ERR_MAX_EVALS`: Error occurred when a client attempted to invoke
  server issuance with a number of inputs that is larger than
  server-specified max_evals value.
- `ERR_PROOF_VALIDATION`: Error occurred when a client is unable to
  verify the proof that is part of the server's response.
- `ERR_DOUBLE_SPEND`: Error occured when a client has attempted to
  redeem a token that has already been used for authorization.

# Generalized protocol overview {#overview}

In this document, we want to provide a client (C) with the capability to
authenticate itself in a lightweight manner to a server (S). The
authorization mechanism should not reveal to the server anything about
the client; in addition, the client should not be able to forge valid
credentials in situations where it does not possess any. These
requirements are covered in {{sec-requirements}}.

In this section, we will give a broad overview of how the Privacy Pass
protocol functions in achieving these goals. The generic protocol can be
split into three phases: initialisation, issuance and redemption. These
three phases are built upon the Privacy Pass API in {{pp-api}}. We show
later ({{voprf-protocol}}) that this API can be implemented using an
underlying VOPRF protocol. We provide this extra layer of abstraction to
allow building extensions into the Privacy Pass protocol that go beyond
what is specified in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.

## Key initialisation phase {#key-init-phase}

In the initialisation phase, the server generates the configuration that
it will use for future instantiations of the protocol. It MUST broadcast
the generated configuration, along with the public key, so that
clients are aware of which configuration to use when interacting with
the server.

In situations where the number of clients are small, a server perform
this action by sending the data to the client directly. But in situations
where there is a large number of clients, the best way of doing is likely
to be via posting this information in a public bulletin board. We assume
that the server only has a single configuration in place at any one time.
There are privacy restrictions related to this that are described in more
detail in the architectural document {{draft-davidson-pp-architecture}}.

We give a diagrammatic representation of the initialisation phase below.

~~~
  C(cfgs)                                                     S(s_id)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
                            (s_cfg, s_update) = PP_Server_Setup(s_id)

                            s_update
                      <-------------------

  c_cfg = PP_Client_Setup(s_id,s_update)
  cfgs.set(update.s_id,c_cfg)
~~~

In the following (and as above), we will assume that the server `S` is
uniquely identifiable by an internal attribute `s_id`. We assume the same
internal attribute exists for the public key `s_cfg.pub_key`. This id
for the public key can be obtained, for example, by hashing the contents
of the object --either the name or underlying contained bytes -- using a
collision-resistant hash function, such as SHA-256.

Note that the client stores their own configuration in the map `cfgs`
for future Privacy Pass interactions with `S`.

## Issuance phase {#issuance-phase}

The issuance phase allows the client to construct `RedemptionToken`
object resulting from an interaction with a server `S` that it has
previously interacted with. We give a diagrammatic overview of the
protocol below.

~~~
  C(cfgs,store,m)                                            S(s_cfg)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
                              S.s_id
                      <------------------

  c_cfg = cfgs.get(S.s_id)
  issue_input = PP_Generate(c_cfg, m)
  msg = issue_input.msg_data
  process = issue_input.client_process_data

                               msg
                      ------------------->

                                  issue_resp = PP_Issue(s_cfg,c_dat)

                           issue_resp
                      <-------------------

  tokens = PP_Process(c_cfg,issue_resp,process)
  store[S.s_id].push(tokens)
~~~

In the diagram above, the client MUST know the supported server
configuration before it interacts with the Privacy Pass API. The client
input `store` is used for appending redemption tokens that are linked to
the server id `S.s_id`.

## Redemption phase {#redemption-phase}

The redemption phase allows the client to reauthenticate to the server,
using data that it has received from a previous issuance phase. We lay
out the security requirements in {{sec-requirements}} that establish
that the client redemption data is not linkable to any given issuance
session.

~~~
  C(cfgs,store,aux)                                   S(s_cfg,ds_idx)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
                               S.id
                        <------------------

  c_cfg = cfgs.get(S.s_id)
  token = store[S.s_id].pop()
  msg = PP_Redeem(c_cfg,token,aux)

                               msg
                        ------------------>

                               if (ds_idx.includes(msg.data)) {
                                 panic(ERR_DOUBLE_SPEND)
                               }
                               resp = PP_Verify(s_cfg,msg)
                               if (resp.success) {
                                 ds_idx.push(msg.data)
                               }

                                resp
                        <------------------
  Output resp
~~~

The client input `aux` is arbitrary byte data that is used for linking
the redemption request to the specific session. We RECOMMEND that `aux`
is constructed as the following concatenated byte-encoded data:

~~~
${C.s_id} .. ${S.s_id} .. ${current_time()} .. ${requested_resource()}
~~~

The usage of `current_time()` allows the server to check that the
redemption request has happened in an appropriate time window. The
function `requested_resource()` is an optional suffix that relates to
any specific resources that the client has requested from the server, in
order to trigger the authorization request.

### Double-spend protection

To protect against clients that attempt to spend a value `msg.data` more
than once, the server uses an index, `ds_idx`, to collect valid inputs
and then check against it in future sessions. Since this store needs to
only be optimized for storage and querying, a structure such as a Bloom
filter suffices. Importantly, the server MUST only eject this storage
after a key rotation occurs since all previous client data will be
rendered obsolete after such an event.

## Handling errors

It is possible for the API functions from {{pp-functions}} to return one
of the errors indicated in {{errors}} rather than their expected value.
In these cases, we assume that the entire protocol execution panics with
the value of the error.

If a panic occurs during the server's operations for one of the
documented errors, then the server returns an error response indicating
the error that occurred.

# Security requirements {#sec-requirements}

We discuss the security requirements that are necessary to uphold when
instantiating the Privacy Pass protocol. In particular, we focus on the
security requirements of "unlinkability", and "unforgeability".
Informally, the notion of unlinkability is required to preserve the
privacy of the client in the redemption phase of the protocol. The
notion of unforgeability is to protect against adversarial clients that
look to subvert the security of the protocol.

Since these are cryptographic security requirements we discuss them with
respect to a polynomial-time algorithm known as the adversary that is
looking to subvert the security guarantee. More details on both security
requirements can be found in {{DGSTV18}} and {{KLOR20}}.

Note that the privacy requirements of the protocol are covered in the
architectural framework document {{draft-davidson-pp-architecture}}.

## Unlinkability {#unlinkability}

Informally, the "unlinkability" requirement states that it is impossible
for an adversarial server to link the client's message in a redemption
session, to any previous issuance session that it has encountered.

Formally speaking the security model is the following:

- The adversary runs `PP_Server_Setup` and generates a key-pair `(key,
  pub_key)`.
- The adversary specifies a number `Q` of issuance phases to initiate,
  where each phase `i in 1..Q` consists of `m_i` server evaluations.
- The adversary runs `PP_Issue` using the key-pair that it generated on
  each of the client messages in the issuance phase.
- When the adversary wants, it stops the issuance phase, and a random
  number `l` is picked from `1..Q`.
- A redemption phase is initiated with a single token with index `i`
  randomly sampled from `1..m_l`.
- The adversary guesses an index `l_guess` corresponding to the index of
  the issuance phase that it believes the redemption token was received
  in.
- The adversary succeeds if `l == l_guess`.

The security requirement is that the adversary has only a negligible
probability of success greater than `1/Q`.

## One-more unforgeability {#unforgeability}

The one-more unforgeability requirement states that it is hard for any
adversarial client that has received `m` valid tokens from a server to
redeem `m+1` of them. In essence, this requirement prevents a malicious
client from being able to forge valid tokens based on the server
responses that it sees.

The security model takes the following form:

- A server is created that runs `PP_Server_Setup` and broadcasts the
  `ServerUpdate` message `s_update`.
- The adversary runs `PP_Client_Setup` on `s_update`.
- The adversary specifies a number `Q` of issuance phases to initiate
  with the server, where each phase `i in 1..Q` consists of `m_i` server
  evaluations. Let `m = sum(m_i)` where `i in 1..Q`.
- The client receives Q responses, where the response with index `i`
  contains `m_i` individual tokens.
- The adversary initiates `m_adv` redemption sessions with the server
  and the server verifies that the sessions are successful (return
  true), and that each request includes a unique token. The adversary
  succeeds in `m_succ =< m_adv` redemption sessions.
- The adversary succeeds if `m_succ > m`.

The security requirement is that the adversarial client has only a
negligible probability of succeeding.

Note that {{KLOR20}} strengthens the capabilities of the adversary, in
comparison to the original work of {{DGSTV18}}. In {{KLOR20}}, the
adversary is provided with oracle access that allows it to verify that
the server responses in the issuance phase are valid.

## Double-spend protection

All issuing servers should implement a robust, global storage-query
mechanism for checking that tokens sent by clients have not been spent
before. Such tokens only need to be checked for each issuer
individually. This prevents clients from "replaying" previous requests,
and is necessary for achieving the unforgeability requirement.

# VOPRF instantiation {#voprf-protocol}

In this section, we show how to instantiate the functional API in
{{pp-api}} with the VOPRF protocol described in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.
Moreover, we show that this protocol satisfies the security requirements
laid out in {{sec-requirements}}, based on the security proofs provided
in {{DGSTV18}} and {{KLOR20}}.

## VOPRF conventions

The VOPRF ciphersuite {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} used determines
the member functions and prime-order group used by the protocol. We
detail a number of specific conventions here that we use for interacting
with the specific ciphersuite.

### Ciphersuites

Let `F` denote a generic VOPRF API function as detailed in
{{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} (Section TODO), and let `ciph` denote the
ciphersuite that is used for instantiating the VOPRF. In this document,
we explicitly write `ciph.F` to show that `F` is explicitly evaluated
with respect to `ciph`.

In addition, we define the following member functions associated with
the ciphersuite.

- `recover_ciphersuite_from_id(id)`: Takes a string identifier `id` as
  input, and outputs a VOPRF ciphersuite. Returns `null` if `id` is not
  recognized.
- `group()`: Returns the prime-order group associated with the
  ciphersuite.
- `H1()`: The function `H1()` defined in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}
  (Section TODO). This function allows deterministically mapping
  arbitrary bytes to a random element of the group. In the elliptic
  curve setting, this is achieved using the functions defined in
  {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}.

### Prime-order group conventions

We detail a few functions that are required of the prime-order group
`GG` used by the VOPRF in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.

Let `p` be the order of the Galois field `GF(p)` associated with the
group `GG`. We expose the following functions associated with `GG`.

- `GG.generator()`: Returns the fixed generator associated with the
  group `GG`.
- `GG.scalar_field()`: Provides access to the field `GF(p)`.
- `GG.scalar_field().random()`: Samples a scalar uniformly at random
  from GF(p). This can be done by sampling a random sequence of bytes
  that produce a scalar `r`, where `r < p` is satisfied (via
  rejection-sampling).

We also use the following functions for transitioning between different
data types.

- `as_bytes()`: For a scalar element of `GG.scalar_field()`, or an
  element of `GG`; the `as_bytes()` functions serializes the element
  into bytes and returns this array as output.
- `as_scalar()`: Interprets a sequence of bytes as a scalar value in
  `GG.scalar_field()`. For an array of byte arrays, we define the
  function `as_scalars()` to individually deserialize each of the
  individual byte arrays into a scalar and output a new array containing
  each scalar value.
- `as_element()`: Interprets a sequence of bytes as a group element in
  `GG`. For an array of byte arrays, we define the function
  `as_elements()` to individually deserialize each of the individual
  byte arrays into a single group element and output a new array
  containing each of these elements.

## API instantiation {#voprf-api}

For the explicit signatures of each of the functions, refer to
{{pp-functions}}.

Note: at this stage we use the non-verifiable VOPRF API functions rather
than the verifiable equivalents (`Eval` rather than `VerifiableEval`),
as we do not need to recompute the proof data that is used for producing
verifiable outputs at this stage.

## Security justification

The protocol that we devise in {{overview}}, coupled with the API
instantiation in {{voprf-api}}, are equivalent to the protocol
description in {{DGSTV18}}. In {{DGSTV18}}, it is proven that this
protocol satisfies the security requirements of unlinkability
({{unlinkability}}) and unforgeability ({{unforgeability}}).

The unlinkability property follows unconditionally as the view of the
adversary in the redemption phase is distributed independently of the
issuance phase. The unforgeability property follows from the one-more
decryption security of the ElGamal cryptosystem {{DGSTV18}}. In
{{KLOR20}} it is also proven that this protocol satisfies the stronger
notion of unforgeability, where the adversary is granted a verification
oracle, under the chosen-target Diffie-Hellman assumption.

Note that the existing security proofs do not leverage the VOPRF
primitive as a black-box in the security reductions. Instead, it relies
on the underlying operations in a non-black-box manner. Hence, an
explicit reduction from the generic VOPRF primitive to the Privacy Pass
protocol would strengthen these security guarantees.

# Ciphersuites {#pp-ciphersuites}

The Privacy Pass protocol essentially operates as a wrapper around the
instantiation of the VOPRF that is used in {{voprf-protocol}}. There is
no extra cryptographic machinery used on top of what is established in
the VOPRF protocol. Therefore, the ciphersuites that we support are the
transitively exposed from the underlying VOPRF functionality, we detail
these below. Each of the ciphersuites is detailed in
{{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.

- VOPRF-P384-HKDF-SHA512-SSWU-RO
  - maximum security parameter: 192 bits
- VOPRF-curve448-HKDF-SHA512-ELL2-RO
  - maximum security parameter: 224 bits
- VOPRF-P521-HKDF-SHA512-SSWU-RO
  - maximum security parameter: 256 bits

When referring to the 'maximum security parameter' size above, we are
referring to the _maximum_ effective key length of the ciphersuite, as
specified in {{NIST}}. The reason that this is the maximum length is
because there may be attacks that serve to lower the actual value of the
security parameter. See {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} for more details.

Note than any extension to the Privacy Pass protocol that modifies
either VOPRF instantiation, or the way that the Privacy Pass API is
implemented, MUST specify its own ciphersuites.

# Extensions framework policy {#extensions}

The intention with providing the Privacy Pass API in {{pp-api}} is to
allow new instantiations of the Privacy Pass protocol. These
instantiations may provide either modified VOPRF constructions, or
simply implement the API in a completely different way.

Extensions to this initial draft SHOULD be specified as separate
documents taking one of two possible routes:

- Produce new VOPRF-like primitives that use the same public API
  provided in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} to implement the Privacy Pass API,
  but with different internal operations.
- Implement the Privacy Pass API in a different way to the proposed
  implementation in {{voprf-protocol}}.

If an extension requires changing the generic protocol description as
described in {{overview}}, then the change may have to result in changes
to the draft specification here also.

Each new extension that modifies the internals of the protocol in either
of the two ways MUST re-justify that the extended protocol
still satisfies the security requirements in {{sec-requirements}}.
Protocol extensions MAY put forward new security guarantees if they
are applicable.

The extensions MUST also conform with the extension framework policy as
set out in the architectural framework document. For example, this may
concern any potential impact on client privacy that the extension may
introduce.

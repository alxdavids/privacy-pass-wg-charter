This document specifies an integration for Privacy Pass over an HTTP
API, along with recommendations on how key commitments are stored and
accessed by HTTP-based consumers.

# Introduction

The Privacy Pass protocol as described in {{draft-davidson-pp-protocol}}
can be integrated with a number of different settings, from server to
server communication to browsing the internet.

In this document, we will provide an API to use for integrating Privacy
Pass with an HTTP framework. Providing the format of HTTP requests and
responses needed to implement the Privacy Pass protocol.

## Terminology

The following terms are used throughout this document.

- Server: A service that provides the server-side functionality required
  by the protocol documented here (typically denoted S).
- Client: An entity that seeks authorization from a server that supports
  interactions in the Privacy Pass protocol (typically denoted C).
- Key: The secret key used by the Server for authorizing client data.
- Commitment: Alternative name for Server's public key corresponding to
  the secret key that they hold.

We assume that all protocol messages are encoded into raw byte format
before being sent. We use the TLS presentation language [RFC8446] to
describe the structure of protocol messages.

## Layout

- {{wrapping}}: Describes the wrapping of messages within HTTP
  requests/responses.
- {{server-config}}: Describes how HTTP clients retrieve server
  configurations and key commitments.
- {{issuance}}: Describes how issuance requests are performed via a HTTP
  API.
- {{redemption}}: Describes how redemption requests are performed via a
  HTTP API.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

# Privacy Pass HTTP API Wrapping {#wrapping}

Messages from HTTP-based clients to HTTP-based servers are performed as
GET and POST requests. The messages are sent via the
``Sec-Privacy-Pass`` header.

``Sec-Privacy-Pass`` is a Dictionary Structured Header
[draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-15]. The dictionary has two keys:

- ``type`` whose value is a String conveying the function that is being
  performed with this request.
- ``body`` whose value is a byte sequence containing a Privacy Pass
  protocol message.

Note that the requests may contain addition Headers, request data and
URL parameters that are not specified here, these extra fields should be
ignored, though may be used by the server to determine whether to
fulfill the requested issuance/redemption.

# Server Configuration/Commitments {#server-config}

A client SHOULD fetch the server configuration and current key
commitments prior to performing issuance and redemption. This
configuration is accessible via a ``CONFIG_ENDPOINT``, either provided
by the server or by a global registry that provides consistency and
anonymization guarantees.

## Commitment Registry {#commitment-registry}

To ensure that a server isn't providing different views of their key
material/commitments to different users, servers are expected to write
their commitments to a verifiable data structure.

Using a verifiable log-backed map ([verifiable-data-structures]), the
server can publish their commitments to the log in a way that clients
can detect when the server is attempting to provide a split-view of
their key commitments to different clients.

The key to the map is the ``server_origin``, with the value being:

~~~
struct {
    opaque public_key<1..2^16-1>;
    uint64 expiry;
    uint8 supported_methods; # 3:Issue/Redeem, 2:Redeem, 1:Issue
    opaque signature<1..2^16-1>;
} KeyCommitment;

struct {
    opaque server_id<1..2^16-1>;
    uint16 ciphersuite;
    opaque verification_key<1..2^16-1>;
    KeyCommitment commitments<1..2^16-1>;
}
~~~

The addition to the log is made via a signed message to the log
operator, which verifies the authenticity against a public key
associated with that server origin (either via the Web PKI or a
out-of-band key).

The server SHOULD then store an inclusion proof of the current key
commitment so that it can present it when delivering the key commitment
directly to the client or when the key commitment is being delivered by
a delegated party (other registries/preloaded configuration lists/etc).

The client can then perform a request for the key commitment against
either the global registry or the server as described
{{key-commitment}}.

To avoid user segregation as a result of server configuration/commitment
rotation, the log operator SHOULD enforce limits on how many active
commitments exist and how quickly the commitments are being rotated.
Clients SHOULD reject configurations/commitments that violate their
requirements for avoiding user segregation. These considerations are
discussed as part of {{draft-davidson-pp-architecture}}.


## Server Configuration Retrieval {#config-retrieval}
Inputs:
- ``server_origin``: The origin to retrieve a server configuration for.

No outputs.

1. The client makes an anonymous GET request to
   ``CONFIG_ENDPOINT``/.well-known/privacy-pass with a message of type
   ``fetch-config`` and a body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque server_origin<1..2^16-1>;
}
~~~

2. The server looks up the configuration associated with the origin
   ``server_origin`` and responds with a message of type ``config`` and
   a body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque server_id<1..2^16-1>;
    uint16 ciphersuite;
    opaque commitment_id<1..2^8-1>;
    opaque verification_key<1..2^16-1>;
}
~~~

3. The client then stores the associated configuration state under the
   corresponding ``server_origin``.

(TODO: This might be mergable with key commitment retrieval if server_id
= server_origin)

# Key Commitment Retrieval {#key-commitment}

The client SHOULD retrieve server key commitments prior to both an
issuance and redemption to verify the consistency of the keys and to
monitor for key rotation between issuance and redemption events.

Inputs:
- ``server_origin``: The origin to retrieve a key commitment for.

No outputs.

1. The client fetches the configuration state ``server_id``,
   ``ciphersuite``, ``commitment_id`` associated with ``server_origin``.

2. The client makes an anonymous GET request to
   ``CONFIG_ENDPOINT``/.well-known/privacy-pass with a message of type
   ``fetch-commitment`` and a body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque server_id<1..2^16-1> = server_id;
    opaque commitment_id<1..2^8-1> = commitment_id;
}
~~~

3. The server looks up the current configuration, and constructs a list
   of commitments to return, noting whether a key commitment is valid
   for issuance or redemption or both.

4. The server then responds with a message of type ``commitment`` and a
   body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque public_key<1..2^16-1>;
    uint64 expiry;
    uint8 supported_methods; # 3:Issue/Redeem, 2:Redeem, 1:Issue
    opaque signature<1..2^16-1>;
} KeyCommitment;

struct {
    opaque server_id<1..2^16-1>;
    uint16 ciphersuite;
    opaque verification_key<1..2^16-1>;
    KeyCommitment commitments<1..2^16-1>;
    opaque inclusion_proofs<1..2^16-1>;
}
~~~

5. The client then verifies the signature for each key commitment and
   stores the list of commitments to the current scope. The client
   SHOULD NOT cache the commitments beyond the current scope, as new
   commitments should be fetched for each independent issuance and
   redemption request. The client SHOULD verify the ``inclusion_proofs``
   to confirm that the key commitment has been submitted to a trusted
   registry.

# Privacy Pass Issuance {#issuance}

Inputs:
- ``server_origin``: The origin to request token issuance from.
- ``count``: The number of tokens to request issuance for.

Outputs:
- ``tokens``: A list of tokens that have been signed via the Privacy
  Pass protocol.

1. When a client wants to request tokens from a server, it should first
   fetch a key commitment from the issuer via the process described in
   {{key-commitment}} and keep the result as ``commitment``.

2. The client should then call the ``CLIENT_ISSUE_GEN`` interface
   requesting ``count`` tokens storing the resulting ``c_data``,
   ``i_data``, ``g_data``.

3. The client then makes a POST request to
   <``server_origin``>/.well-known/privacy-pass with a message of type
   ``request-issuance`` and a body of:

~~~
enum { Normal(0) } IssuanceType;

struct {
    IssuanceType type = 0;
    opaque i_data<0..2^16-1> = i_data;
}
~~~

4. The server, upon receipt of the ``request`` should call the
   ``SERVER_ISSUE`` interface with the value of ``i_data`` with a result
   of ``server_issue_resp``.


5. The server should then respond to the POST request with a message of
   type ``issue`` and a body of:

~~~
struct {
    IssuanceType type = request.type;
    uint16 ciphersuite = server_issue_resp.ciphersuite;
    opaque evals<1..2^16-1> = server_issue_resp.evals;
    opaque proof<1..2^16-1> = server_issue_resp.proof;
}
~~~

6. The client should then should call the ``CLIENT_ISSUE_FINISH``
   interface with the resulting ``ciphersuite``, ```evals``, ``proof``,
   and stored ``g_data`` to extract a list of ``tokens``.

7. The client should store the ``public_key`` associated with these
   tokens and the elements of ``tokens`` under storage partitioned by
   the ``server_origin``, accessible only via the Privacy Pass API.

# Privacy Pass Redemption {#redemption}

There are two forms of Privacy Pass redemption that could function under
the HTTP API. Either passing along a token directly to the target
endpoint, which would perform its own redemption {{token-redemption}},
or the client redeeming the token and passing the result along to the
target endpoint. These two methods are described below.

## Generic Token Redemption {#token-redemption}

Inputs:
- ``server_id``: The server ID to redeem a token against.
- ``ciphersuite``: The ciphersuite for this token.
- ``public_key``: The public key associated with this token.
- ``token``: A Privacy Pass token.
- ``additional_data``: Additional data to bind to this token redemption.

Outputs:
- ``result``: The result of the redemption from the server.

1. The client should call the ``CLIENT_REDEEM`` interface with
   ``server_id``, ``ciphersuite``, ``public_key``, ``token`` and
   auxiliary data of ``additional_data`` storing the resulting ``data``
   and ``tag``.

2. The client makes a POST request to
   <``server_origin``>/.well-known/privacy-pass with a message of type
   ``token-redemption`` and a body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque server_id<1..2^16-1> = server_id;
    opaque data<1..2^16-1> = data;
    opaque tag<1..2^16-1> = tag;
    opaque aux<1..2^16-1> = additional_data;
}
~~~

3. The server, upon receipt of ``request`` should call the
   ``SERVER_REDEEM`` interface with the ``data``, ``tag``, ``aux``
   storing the resulting ``resp``.

4. The server should then respond to the POST request with a message of
   type ``redemption-result`` and a signed body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque aux<1..2^16-1> = aux;
    uint8 result = resp;
    opaque signature<1..2^16-1>; // signature of aux and result using
    the server's verification key.
}
~~~

4. The client upon receipt of this message should verify the
   ``signature`` using the ``verification_key`` from the configuration
   and return the ``result``.

## Direct Redemption {#direct-redemption}

Inputs:
- ``server_origin``: The server origin to redeem a token for.
- ``target``: The target endpoint to send the token to.
- ``additional_data``: Additional data to bind to this redemption
  request.

1. When a client wants to redeem tokens for a server, it should first
   fetch a key commitment from the issuer via the process described in
   {{key-commitment}} and keep the result as ``commitment``.

2. The client should then look up the storage partition associated with
   ``server_origin`` and fetch a ``token`` and ``public_key``.

3. The client should verify that the ``public_key`` is in the current
   ``commitment``. If not, it should discard the token and fail the
   redemption attempt.

4. As part of the request to ``target``, the client will include the
   token as part of the request in the ``Sec-Privacy-Pass`` header along
   with whatever other parameters are being passed as part of the
   request to ``target``. The header will contain a message of type
   ``token-redemption`` with a body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque server_id<1..2^16-1> = server_id;
    uint16 ciphersuite = ciphersuite;
    opaque public_key<1..2^16-1> = public_key;
    opaque token<1..2^16-1> = token;
    opaque additional_data<1..2^16-1> = additional_data;
}
~~~

At this point, the ``target`` can perform a generic redemption as
described in {{token-redemption}} by forwarding the message included in
the request to ``target``.

## Delegated Redemption {#delegated-redemption}

Inputs:
- ``server_origin``: The server origin to redeem a token for.
- ``target``: The target endpoint to send the token to.
- ``additional_data``: Additional data to bind to this redemption
  request.

1. When a client wants to redeem tokens for a server, it should first
   fetch a key commitment from the issuer via the process described in
   {{key-commitment}} and keep the result as ``commitment``.

2. The client should then look up the storage partition associated with
   ``server_origin`` and fetch a ``token`` and ``public_key``.

3. The client should verify that the ``public_key`` is in the current
   ``commitment``. If not, it should discard the token and fail the
   redemption attempt.

4. The client constructs a bytestring ``aux`` made up of the ``target``,
   the current ``timestamp``, and ``additional_data``:

~~~
struct {
    opaque target<1..2^16-1>;
    uint64 timestamp;
    opaque additional_data<0..2^16-1>;
}
~~~

5. The client then performs a token redemption as described in
   {{token-redemption}}. Storing the resulting ``redemption-result``
   message.

6. As part of the request to ``target``, the client will include the
   redemption result as part of the request in the ``Sec-Privacy-Pass``
   header along with whatever other parameters are being passed as part
   of the request to ``target``. The header will contain a message of
   type ``signed-redemption-result`` with a body of:

~~~
struct {
    opaque server_origin<1..2^16-1>;
    opaque target<1..2^16-1>;
    uint64 timestamp;
    opaque additional_data<1..2^16-1> = additional_data;
    opaque signed_redemption<1..2^16-1>;
}
~~~

At this point, the ``target`` can verify the integrity of
``signed_redemption.aux`` based on the values of ``target``,
``timestamp``, and ``additional_data`` and verify the signature of the
redemption result by querying the current configuration of the Privacy
Pass server. The inclusion of ``target`` and ``timestamp`` proves that
the server attested to the validity of the token in relation to this
particular request.
